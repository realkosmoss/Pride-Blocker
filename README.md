# Pride-Blocker

A browser extension to block pride-related content on websites.  
*Still a work in progress, might not catch everything.*

### Disclaimer

This is a personal content filter made for people who want to decide what they see online. It’s not about hate or discrimination, just about personal preference. If you don’t want to see pride stuff on every site, this tool is for you.

No hate, no harassment, no agenda. Just a simple way to filter what annoys me. If that upsets some people, that’s their problem, I’m not here to please everyone.

Use it responsibly and follow your local laws and platform rules.

## Inspiration

I made this because I didn’t want pride flags constantly shoved in my face on unrelated sites. Simple as that.
