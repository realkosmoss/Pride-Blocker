# Pride-Blocker

A browser extension that lets you block pride-related content on websites.  
Note: It’s still a work in progress and might not catch everything perfectly.

### Disclaimer

This project is **not intended to promote hate, discrimination, or harassment** of any kind. It is a **personal content filter** for individuals who want more control over what they see online. Choosing to filter certain topics is a matter of **personal preference** — it’s not meant to target or silence anyone.

We respect the rights of everyone, including the LGBTQIA+ community. This tool does **not** support hate speech or harassment, and users should follow all laws and platform rules when using it.

This is simply a project about user choice and browsing control — nothing more.

## Inspiration

I made this after visiting [perchance.org](https://perchance.org/welcome) and seeing some pride flags I personally didn’t care for. That’s all — just a small project to make my browsing experience more comfortable.
